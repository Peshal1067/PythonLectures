    "# Extending Python with Compiled Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous session, we talked about ways to get performance out of Python using vectorization strategies within NumPy.  Today we're going to talk about approaches which involve **interfacing Python to external compiled code**, or **converting Python code to compilable code**.  There are several different approaches.  We'll give examples of solving a problem by several means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Ctypes](http://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html): the C-linking utilities included in the Python standard library\n",
    "- [F2Py](http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/usersguide/): the Fortran to Python utility which is bundled with NumPy\n",
    "- [Cython](http://cython.org/): a module that allows conversion of Python and Python-like code to C\n",
    "- [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/): a Python to LLVM bytecode converter\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no way to go into depth on all of these, but I mainly just want to show some examples so that you know the types of problems they solve.  At the above links, you'll find more in-depth documentation and tutorials."

    "### A Note on CFFI and PyPy\n",
    "\n",
    "A newer option that I've not personally used (but is probably the way of the future for wrapping compiled code in Cython) is the [C Foreign Function Interface (CFFI)](https://cffi.readthedocs.org/). One huge advantage of this is that it works with [PyPy](http://pypy.org/), where the other options don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyPy](http://pypy.org/) is a JIT compiler for Python written in Python.  PyPy doesn't support the C backend which most scientific tools rely on, so it's not extremely useful for scientific computing. If the functionality of numpy, scipy, etc. is rewritten using the CFFI in the future, though, PyPy may become a competetive option."

    "### Other Options\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other options we won't talk about here, because they have mostly been superseded by the above tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Python C API](http://docs.python.org/2/c-api/): Python is implemented in C, and you can actually write C code which will compile to a Python module!  This is extremely low-level, and I would only recommend it if you enjoy pain (see Dan Foreman-Mackie's [blog post](http://dan.iel.fm/posts/python-c-extensions/) for a concise-as-possible introduction)\n",
    "- [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/): the Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator, can generate wrappers from a variety of low-level languages to a variety of high-level languages.  It's used heavily by LSST and other projects.\n",
    "- [Weave](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/weave.html): included in SciPy, weave is a method of putting C snippets within a Python program.  It's largely been superseded by Cython in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal approach depends on the desired use-case.  We'll go through a few examples, from lowest to highest level:"

    "## Why Extend Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons you might wish to use the tools outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sometimes vectorization of algorithms can lead to excessive memory usage, because it relies on temporary arrays to hold intermediate results.  Directly implementing the routine in compiled code can lead to more efficient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sometimes problems cannot be implemented as vectorized NumPy operations.  An example is in tree-based algorithms.  This is why I used cython when I wrote the k-neighbors and kernel density estimation code within ``sklearn.neighbors``.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sometimes there are legacy code-bases that you don't want to have to re-implement: you'd much rather just write some sort of bindings to call the old code from within Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll do a **brief demonstration** of some of these tools.  These tools do have a bit of a learning curve, so I'll provide references for where you might look to go deeper.  The purpose of this lecture is to get a taste of some of the better options for addressing these problems."

    "## Ctypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Ctypes is part of the standard library, and offers tools to **call routines from compiled libraries with Python**.  These can either be routines in your system libraries, or in shared libraries you compile yourself.  We'll see examples of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "One weakness of ctypes is that it can be **very platform-specific**.  For example, shared-library extensions are different from platform to platform (e.g. ``*.so`` on Linux, ``*.dll`` on Windows, ``*.dylib`` on OSX).  Other platform-by-platform issues like 32/64 bit can also make things difficult."
